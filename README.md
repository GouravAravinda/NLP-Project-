# NLP-Project-Short Messages Spam Detection using Deep Learning 
The motive behind this project was to ensure that we are able to find efficient methods to detect any spam messages that is sent to a user. 
We studied about the use of ensemble learning and other classifiers that were trained to perform these tasks.
We finally decided to use the LSTM and GRU models to perform our classifications. Each had their own advantages and disadvantages. 
We will be moving forward and updating till we create a self learning model that can take in more data and retrain itself as that would allow it to be more 
customised for any user.
